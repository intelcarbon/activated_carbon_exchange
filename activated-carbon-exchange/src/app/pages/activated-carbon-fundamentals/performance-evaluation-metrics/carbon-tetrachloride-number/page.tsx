        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          The Carbon Tetrachloride Number, also known as the CTC Number, is a performance evaluation metric used to assess the adsorptive capacity of activated carbon, specifically towards volatile organic compounds. It is defined as the percentage of carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄) adsorbed by the activated carbon under standard conditions. This metric is particularly useful in industrial applications where the removal of organic vapors is required.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 text-gray-800">Methodology</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          The test for determining the CTC Number involves exposing a known weight of activated carbon to a vapor phase of carbon tetrachloride at a specific temperature (usually around 25°C) and relative pressure. After a set period, the amount of CCl₄ adsorbed by the carbon is measured. The CTC Number is then calculated as a percentage, indicating the efficiency of the carbon in adsorbing CCl₄ from the air.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 text-gray-800">Significance</h2>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-4">
          <li>
            <strong>Adsorption Capacity:</strong> The CTC Number is a direct measure of the activated carbon's capacity to adsorb volatile organic compounds. A higher CTC Number indicates a greater adsorption capacity.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Comparative Analysis:</strong> It allows for the comparison of different activated carbon materials under uniform conditions, aiding in the selection of the most effective carbon for specific applications.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Quality Control:</strong> This metric is also used in quality control processes by manufacturers of activated carbon to ensure consistency and performance of their products.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 text-gray-800">Considerations</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          <strong>Specificity:</strong> While the CTC Number provides valuable information on the adsorption capacity of activated carbon for organic vapors, it is specific to carbon tetrachloride. The adsorption performance may vary with different compounds due to differences in molecular size, polarity, and other chemical properties.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          <strong>Environmental and Safety Concerns:</strong> Carbon tetrachloride is a hazardous material, known to be a potent liver toxin and a suspected carcinogen. Safety precautions are necessary when conducting this test, and environmental regulations may limit its use. Alternatives to CCl₄ are being explored for assessing the adsorptive capacity of activated carbons.
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 text-gray-800">Conclusion</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          The Carbon Tetrachloride Number is a critical metric for evaluating the performance of activated carbon in adsorbing volatile organic compounds. It offers a standardized method for assessing and comparing the adsorptive capacities of different activated carbons. However, the specificity of the test to CCl₄ and associated health and environmental concerns necessitate careful handling and consideration of alternative methods for a more comprehensive evaluation of activated carbon's performance across a broader range of compounds.
