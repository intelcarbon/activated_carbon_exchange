        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          The concept of <span className="italic">Pore Size Distribution (PSD)</span> in activated carbon is a critical parameter that significantly influences its adsorption capacity and selectivity. Understanding PSD is essential for tailoring activated carbon to specific adsorption applications, though here, we focus solely on its implications on the material's physical and chemical characteristics without veering into application specifics.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 text-gray-800">Importance of Pore Size Distribution</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          PSD impacts the behavior of activated carbon in several fundamental ways:
        </p>
        <ol className="list-decimal list-inside text-gray-700 mb-4">
          <li>
            <strong>Adsorption Dynamics:</strong> Different pore sizes (micropores, mesopores, and macropores) play distinct roles in the adsorption process. <span className="italic">Micropores</span>, typically less than 2 nm in diameter, are primarily responsible for adsorbing small molecules through Van der Waals forces. <span className="italic">Mesopores</span> (2-50 nm) and <span className="italic">macropores</span> (greater than 50 nm) facilitate the transport of molecules to the micropores and support the adsorption of larger molecules, respectively.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Selectivity:</strong> The PSD affects the selectivity of activated carbon towards different adsorbates. A predominantly microporous structure is ideal for adsorbing small molecules, while a broader distribution including meso and macropores can accommodate larger molecules.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Capacity:</strong> Generally, a larger total pore volume, especially within the microporous region, translates to a higher adsorption capacity since it increases the surface area available for adsorption.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 text-gray-800">Characterization Techniques</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          The analysis and characterization of PSD in activated carbon are performed using various techniques, with <span className="italic">Nitrogen Adsorption Isotherms</span> being among the most prominent. This method, conducted at the liquid nitrogen temperature of 77 K, allows for the determination of specific surface areas, total pore volume, and the distribution of pore sizes. Other techniques include <span className="italic">Mercury Porosimetry</span> and <span className="italic">CO₂ Adsorption</span> for assessing smaller micropores.
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 text-gray-800">Influencing Factors</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          The development of PSD in activated carbon is influenced by both the precursor material and the activation process. <span className="italic">Activation Methods</span> such as physical activation with steam or CO₂ and chemical activation using agents like phosphoric acid or zinc chloride can alter the PSD. The choice of precursor, whether it be <span className="italic">Coconut Shell</span>, <span className="italic">Wood</span>, or <span className="italic">Coal</span>, also plays a pivotal role in defining the initial framework for the PSD.
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 text-gray-800">Significance</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Understanding and controlling the PSD within activated carbon allows for the optimization of the material's performance for specific challenges. By manipulating the PSD through the activation process and choice of precursor, manufacturers can enhance the adsorption properties of activated carbon, tailoring it to efficiently remove targeted contaminants from air or liquid streams.
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 text-gray-800">Conclusion</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          The <span className="italic">Pore Size Distribution</span> in activated carbon is a defining characteristic that influences its adsorption efficiency and selectivity. Through careful characterization and control of PSD, it is possible to optimize activated carbon for specific uses, enhancing its utility in various sectors. Knowledge of PSD is indispensable for developing high-performance activated carbon materials tailored to meet precise adsorption requirements.
