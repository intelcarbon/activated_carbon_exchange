        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 text-gray-800">Structural Properties and Pore Size Distribution</h2>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-4">
          <li>
            <strong>Micro-Porous Structure:</strong> Dominantly composed of micro-pores, coconut shell carbon provides a high surface area crucial for adsorption. This structure is inherent to the material and significantly influences the adsorption efficiency of the resulting activated carbon.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Pore Size Distribution:</strong> The micro-porous nature of coconut shell carbon is a defining characteristic, with the majority of pores being less than 2 nm in diameter. This pore distribution is optimal for the adsorption of small molecules.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 text-gray-800">Ash Content</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          <strong>Low Ash Content:</strong> Coconut shell carbon is characterized by its low ash content, reducing the presence of inorganic impurities. This aspect is vital for maintaining the activated carbon's purity and optimizing its performance in adsorption processes.
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 text-gray-800">Mechanical Strength</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          <strong>High Mechanical Strength:</strong> The carbon derived from coconut shells is known for its durability and resistance to physical stress, which is beneficial for maintaining structural integrity and operational longevity of the activated carbon.
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 text-gray-800">Impurity Profile</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          <strong>Organic and Inorganic Impurities:</strong> The level of inherent impurities within coconut shell carbon affects the purification and activation process efficiency. It's essential to assess these levels to ensure they align with the quality standards for the intended use of the activated carbon.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 text-gray-800">Conclusion</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          The analysis of coconut shell carbon as a precursor focuses on its micro-porous structure, pore size distribution, ash content, and mechanical strength. These properties are directly relevant to its performance in producing high-quality activated carbon. By emphasizing these characteristics, the analysis provides a clear, technical understanding of coconut shell carbon's value as a precursor material, without extending into less pertinent areas such as activation compatibility.
